# About this repo :
This application is an enterprise social network which was a project for my Web Developper training and that I decided to progressively improve.
It has already been deployed using cloud services and you can find the [frontend](https://github.com//ChristopheBouriel/SharePlace-Evolution-UI) and [backend](https://github.com//ChristopheBouriel/SharePlace-Evolution-API) in my repositories. 
You can also read more about this project in my portfolio :

Now, to get the whole app running in containers :

0. Maybe that's useless to say, but you obviously need to have Docker installed on your computer.  

1. Clone this repository

	`git clone https://github.com/ChristopheBouriel/SharePlace-Docker.git`

	If you want the building to be faster and don't feel the need to get a phpMyAdmin connected, execute the following instructions :  
	* enter the root folder of the project and open the docker-compose.yml file
	* remove this part of the file :
	
			phpmyadmin:  
			  depends_on:  
			    - mysql  
			  image: phpmyadmin/phpmyadmin  
			  environment:  
			    PMA_HOST: mysql  
			  links:  
			    - mysql:mysql  
			  ports:  
			    - 8080:80  
			  restart: always
	* save the file

	If you want it to be even faster, don't build Angular inside the container and use the dist folder instead. To do so :  
	* enter the client folder and open the file named Dockerfile
	* suppress everything and replace it with the following lines :
	
			FROM nginx:1.17.1-alpine  
			COPY nginx.conf /etc/nginx/nginx.conf  
			COPY dist/Front-end /usr/share/nginx/html  
			EXPOSE 80  
	* save the file
	* edit the .dockerignore file and delete the word "client"
	* save the file

2. In your terminal, enter the root folder of the project if you're not already there, and just type the command :  
`docker-compose up -d`  
	If you see an error at step 7/10 which stop the process, simply type again the same command :  
	`docker-compose up -d`  
	That will start again where the process was at, and terminate it.  
	*This is likely a problem of timeout because my machine is not really powerfull... but maybe yours too.*

3. Then, just go to localhost:4200 in your browser and try the app.

	If you don't want to create a profile, you can log in with this one :  
	* Username --> Userix
	* Password --> evaluatapp
	
	If you want to try the moderator profil with its specific functionalities :  
	* Username --> Moderator
	* Password --> moderate

	If you decided to install the phpMyAdmin, you can find the panel at localhost:8080 in your browser (the DB name is "sampledb") :  
	* Username --> Root
	* Password --> Root

4. In the end, to stop after testing, type the command :  
	`docker-compose down`  
	If you want to stop and then clear up everything*, type the command :  
	`docker-compose down --rmi all --volume`  
	*Note that you still have to remove node and nginx images manually.
